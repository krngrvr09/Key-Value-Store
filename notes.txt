- I can create a bash script that gives the answer to me.
- I want to compare the performance of python and bash code.

Other options are:
- use mmap to make it faster
    compare the performance of reading from disk vs mmap
- Use a cache
    compare the performance of reading from disk vs cache

Compare performance of bash, python, python with mmap, python with cache.

The code assumes that the file is structured in a certain way.
